# Band Website Project

## Website Link  


## Problems Faced and Decisions Made  
At first, we had to decide what kind of band we are.  
We talked about it and decided to make it funny and light.  
Everyone shared ideas and helped shape the concept.

## My Contribution (Self-assessment)  
I added the mp3 player to the website.  
I also wrote my character bio and wrote the song description.

Honestly, I had a hard time because my everyday English is not strong.  
Sometimes I didn’t understand what others were saying or what the jokes meant.  
So I don’t think I could do my best, and I feel a bit self-disappointed.

## Group Member Assessments  
My group members were very kind and made me feel comfortable.  
They were funny, friendly, and thoughtful.

Lilith did a great job as the leader and finished many tasks!!  
Other members made the design, added images like JPGs and GIFs, and made the website fun to look at!!
