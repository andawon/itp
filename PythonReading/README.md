# Think Python Reading Assignment


## Chapter 1: The Way of the Program

- Something I already knew
  I knew that Python is an interpreted language, which means it runs code line by line and stops if there is an error.

## Chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursion

- Something I already knew 
  I knew we can use `if` statements to control what the program does.

  I knew that a list can hold multiple values together.
